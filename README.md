# libft
Libft is a foundational project in the curriculum of many programming schools, such as 42 and Ecole 1337. It involves creating a custom library in C that replicates standard library functions (like strlen, memcpy, etc.) and introduces new utility functions to enhance coding efficiency.

The goal of Libft is to help developers:

Understand C language fundamentals.
Learn about memory management and data structures.
Create a reusable library for future projects.
Libft repositories on GitHub often showcase students' implementations, making them great resources for inspiration or collaboration.
